# Udacity_Stock-Hawk

This is a project I worked on in [Android Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/)


This app provides:
>Latest Stock info like Symbol, Bid Price, Up and Down price and percentage.
>A years graph data which is customizable. 

Highlights
>And android app which shows you the stocks you need, its bid price, percentage and value changes. 
>It also has a detail view which contains customisable graph of the stock detail upto a year.
>This app was a part of of the Udacity course whose goal was to tune for production where it was RTL supported for Arabic fonts, a widget availability so that the user can see the stocks on the fly, and was compatible for people with poor vision.
